          <p class="important">How did you guys meet?</p>
          <div class="unimportant">
          <p>We met at Kenya National Theatre (KNT).
              There was a play on cancer awareness and Mordecai was one of the judges,
              the play was a fusion of drama, poetry and music.</p>
          <p>Ken was playing all the soundtracks with his guitar and after the play we continued jamming at
            <div class="sidebar">
            <p><span class="highlight">In 2014, H_art the Band got people singing along to their catchy hit 'Uliza Kiatu'.</span>
            <p><span class="highlight">The original and heartfelt song earned them a wide fan base.</span> </p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Although they originally sang and performed for fun, </span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight">their fans have come to embrace their poetic and witty approach to their music.</span> </p>
          </div>
              KNT after we found ourselves idle. From there H_art the band was formed.</p>

          <p class="important">Why did you pick the name H_art the Band?</p>
           <div class="unimportant">
          <p> Means art from the heart.
              The underscore is the bridge between the heart and art
              because aside from music we do art as well,
              we are artistic people.</p>
           </div>
           <p class="important">You all have dreadlocks,
              is that on purpose?</p>
              <p class="unimportant">It was an artistic coincidence.</p>
              <img src="img/self potraits.jpg" alt="picture of a band">
          <p class="important">How has it been trying to make
            a mark in an industry dominated by established bands like,
              Just a Band, Sauti Sol and Elani?</p>
          <p class="unimportant">First off we are not competing; we believe</p>
               <p>that each and every artiste has their own domain, gifted in all areas.</p>
               <p>We are here for one cause and it is art.</p>
               <p>The best person to compete with is yourself.</p>

          <p class="important"> What genre is your music?</p>
          <p class="unimportant">We like to call it Afro-Poetry which is music with an African touch fused with poetry.</p>
